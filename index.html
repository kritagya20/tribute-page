                        Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as ‘MS Dhoni’  was born in a middle-class Rajput family on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand (then in Bihar).

                            His father, Pan Singh, was an employee at MECON. His mother, Devki Devi, is a homemaker. 
                            He completed his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir in Shyamali, Ranchi. <br><br>

                            During his school days, he used to play badminton and football. He played as a goalkeeper in a local football team. 
                            Watching his eye-catchy skills, his football coach sent him to a local cricket club to play cricket. 
                            He never played cricket before but he managed to grab the concept perfectly.
                            His wicket-keeping skills amazed everyone in the club. 
                            He was appointed as the wicketkeeper for the local team on a regular basis. <br><br>

                            Later, he started to focus primarily on cricket and left his glory days of football and badminton behind. 
                            It was a drastic change in his life. He started to take professional coaching after Class X. 
                            He was also a meritorious student and teachers respected him for his versatile nature. 
                            He used to manage his studies and sports sessions perfectly. His family was very supportive of his ambitions.

                        MS Dhoni was selected as the U-19 Bihar cricket squad member in 1998-99. 
                        When he was 18 years old, he played the first match in Ranji Trophy for Bihar and scored a half-century.

                            Just after 5 years, his skills caught the eyes of team selectors of the Indian national cricket team. 
                            His excellent performance and a century for the East Zone helped the team to clinch the Deodhar Trophy. <br><br>

                            His 60 runs also helped his team to clinch the Duleep Trophy. <br><br>

                            As time passed, he joined Indian Railways as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) in Midnapore District, West Bengal in 2000. 
                            He was very honest. He also had a mischievous side. 
                            He once dressed as ghosts with his friends and scared the night guards patrolling the railway quarters. 
                            He eventually became better in his cricketing skills. 
                            His performance in the Triangular Tournament held in Kenya against Pakistan. <br><br>

                            This christened him with a new name ‘clinical destroyer’ of commendable bowling attacks.

                            Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010, 2011, 2018 and the 2021 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles and ended up as a runner-up in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2019 league seasons. <br><br>

                            In 2016, Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), a debuting IPL franchise team made him captain but after poor performance of the team in that season they removed Dhoni from captain's position and chose Steve Smith, then Australian national team captain, for the post. Dhoni played as wicketkeeper batsman in 2017 season for RPS. <br><br>

                            In the 2018 IPL season, CSK returned to IPL, and he was again appointed to lead the franchise by the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in that season and led his side to their third IPL title.
                            As a batsman 2020 and 2021's season was bad for MS Dhoni, he scored 200 runs in 14 innings in 2020 and 116 runs in 16 innings with the poor avarage of 15.29 in 2021 IPL season.

                            In the ODI home series against England, he scored well and was named as a wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy and ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz. 
                            In the same year, during the ODI against Sri Lanka, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings.  <br> <br>
                        
                            In the 2014-15 season, Dhoni played his last test series against Australia and captained the second and third test matches. Dhoni announced his retirement from the Test format, following the third test in Melbourne. In his last test match, Dhoni effected nine dismissals and broke Kumar Sangakkara record for stumpings with 134 in all the formats. <br> <br>
        
                            In 2018, the ban on Chennai Super Kings was uplifted and the team returned to play the IPL. 
                            Dhoni was again contracted by CSK and led the team to win the third IPL title. <br> <br>
                            In 2019, he again captained for CSK and the team emerged to be one of the strongest in the season.

                            In the 2019 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni was selected for the Indian team. 
                            Dhoni played well against South Africa, Australia and West Indies but was criticised for his strike rate against Afghanistan and England.
                            In the semi-finals against New Zealand, Dhoni scored a half-century in the second innings but was run out at a very crucial stage. With his dismissal, India's World Cup run ended.

                        Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket on 15 August 2020 on the day of India's 74th independence by sharing a video on Instagram.

                            He did so by posting a video on Instagram that contained pictures from both the best and the worst moments of his career with the song Mai Pal do Pal ka Shayar Hoon playing in the background. 
                            The video had been captioned as<i> "Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired". </i>Despite the fact that it had been speculated that MS Dhoni would retire shortly, the news came as a shock to everyone. <br> <br>
                            
                            The boy from Ranchi, who made his ODI debut in 2004, changed the face of Indian cricket with his calm demeanour, sharp understanding of the game and astute leadership qualities. <br> <br>
                            Dhoni is one of the most well-liked and respected cricketers in the world, as well as one of the most successful captains.
                            After winning the ICC World T20 in its inaugural edition in South Africa in 2007, he led India to victory in the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011.
                            Dhoni made history by being the first and only captain to win all three ICC Trophies when India won the ICC Champions Trophy in England in 2013. <br> <br>
                            While his exploits in the limited-overs formats are well-known, it was also under his supervision that India rose to the top of the Test rankings in 2009, where they remained for over 600 days.
                            He has guided India to 21 Test victories at home, the most of any Indian captain. <br> <br>
                            Leaving behind a rich legacy that will be difficult to replicate, Dhoni holds the record for most international matches as captain (332). Unarguably the quickest man behind the wicket, Dhoni has 195 international stumpings, the most by any wicket-keeper.
